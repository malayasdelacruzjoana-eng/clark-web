    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2><p>
  Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
</p>

<p>
  She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <em>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</em>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.
